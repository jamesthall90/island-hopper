# island-hopper
Simple iOS application developed as a prototype for potential use with the Island Hopper Festival. 
This, unfortunately, did not come to fruition, and this app is kept for historical purposes only.

The application uses [AACarousel](https://github.com/Alan881/AACarousel) to display sample images in a slider/carousel, 
which are pulled directly from their respective URLs and cached using [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher).
